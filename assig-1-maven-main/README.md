# COMP261 Assignment One
## The Wellington Bus Network
This assignment showcases essential software skills, encased in an ergonomic application, in which users are able to search up bus routes in the Wellington Region. These skills include data scanning from files, constructing appropriate data structures, displaying data visually and the A* Search algorithm. 

## The Data
This assignment displayed my ability to scan data from appropriate files. The data is for Wellington City, obtained from https://opendata.metlink.org.nz/.  The data was downloaded in Feb 2022 and the txt files have not been altered.

## Data Structures
Appropriate data structures, such as tries and hashmaps, were used to ensure time efficient and consistent (O Notation) searches.

## Visual Display
I have created a user interface which displayed scaleable, interactable data, using nodes and edges.
